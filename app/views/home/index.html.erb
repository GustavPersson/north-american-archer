      <p>
				I am a software developer with good skills and a special interest in modern web technologies and games programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have an interest in front and back end development, and especially enjoy debugging and experimentation, in order to keep quality at a high level. I enjoy working in agile projects, and am highly flexible.
			</p>
      <p>
        I studied Games Programming for 3 years at the Blekinge Institute of Technology, before joining the Karlskrona branch of the consultancy firm HiQ in 2010, after which I've mostly worked with Web development, while trying to keep as up to date with games programming as possible.
      </p>
			<p>
				My goal is to be part of a team that works with cutting edge technologies and projects, where I am able to continually develop my skills, learn new things and take a lot of responsibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm used to working in Windows, Linux and Mac systems, with a wide array of tools. My main programming languages are C++, Java and JavaScript. I am especially experienced in Web programming, and have an education in Games programming. The last years I've been working with both back and front end development on web portals and web applications, modernized and customized web sites for mobile content, and a mobile operating system based on web technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am not afraid to voice my opinion and take a discussion, and enjoy taking responsibility for different projects. During my free time I'm a passionate Malmö FF supporter, I have a season pass on the north stand, I enjoy watching sports, and spend whatever extra time I have playing computer games.

					The application is built with the Spring MVC and Security frameworks on top of a backend built with Java EE.

					Worked with the Telenor.se team to maintain and improve Telenor’s main page and web shop.

					Over a period of a few months, I worked with a project to create a new proof-of-concept portal from the bottom up, based on technologies from both Telenor.se and Mina Sidor.
